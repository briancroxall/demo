I’m the Digital Humanities Librarian in Brown University Library and the [Brown Center for Digital Scholarship](https://library.brown.edu/cds/). In this position, I imagine, design, and manage digital scholarship projects in collaboration with faculty, colleagues, and students.

Prior to coming to Brown, I worked at Emory University’s [Center for Digital Scholarship Libraries](http://digitalscholarship.emory.edu/) as Digital Humanities Strategist. As Lecturer of English, I also taught courses in the English Department, including “Introduction to Digital Humanities.” I’m passionate about integrating digital approaches into pedagogy.

I completed my Ph.D at Emory University in 2008, investigating the relationships between technology, media, and psychological trauma. After that, I taught taught modern and contemporary American literature as well as courses on media studies, digital culture, and war fiction for a year at Emory and another year at Clemson University. Following that, I was Emory’s first CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow and Emerging Technologies Librarian. Somewhere in there, I co-edited a journal issue on the subject of steampunk, edited a cluster at #Alt-Academy, and wrote for the group blog ProfHacker. I am an elected member of the Executive Council of the MLA and the Association for Computers and the Humanities. I use Twitter on occasion and track my publications with [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5602-6830).
